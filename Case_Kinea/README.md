# Financial Risk Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains analyses related to market risk, fixed income valuation, and credit risk assessment. The project is divided into three main parts: market risk evaluation, bond pricing and duration calculation, and corporate credit risk analysis.

## Project Structure

### Part I: Market Risk
This section focuses on risk assessment for a portfolio of 20 selected stocks.

#### Objectives:
1. **Volatility Calculation**: Compute the 12-month volatility for each stock.
2. **Portfolio Volatility**: Evaluate the volatility of an equally weighted portfolio (5% per stock).
3. **Minimum Volatility Portfolio**: Optimize the allocation to minimize portfolio volatility (0-10% per stock).
4. **Maximum Sharpe Ratio Portfolio**: Find the allocation that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, considering constraints (0-10% per stock).

#### Data Sources:
- Historical stock prices from [Okanebox](https://www.okanebox.com.br/)

### Part II: Fixed Income Analysis (NTN-B Bonds)
This section focuses on modeling the cash flow of NTN-B bonds with semiannual interest payments.

#### Objectives:
1. **Cash Flow Modeling**: Calculate periodic interest payments and principal repayment based on projected inflation and real interest rates.
2. **Present Value Calculation**: Discount future cash flows to determine the current bond price (PU).
3. **Macaulay Duration**: Compute the bondâ€™s duration to measure its sensitivity to interest rate changes.
